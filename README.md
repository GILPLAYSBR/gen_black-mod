Gen_black script made by Rangel, modified by Frito, and now modified by ME

Original version: https://linhasverticais.wordpress.com </br>
Frito version: https://static1.downloadgamemods.com/Live%20for%20Speed/Tools/lfsdk.7z

Requires:</br>
Python 2.5 or 2.7</br>
PIL (Python Imaging Library) for python 2.5 or 2.7

If you run this script with pypy it can increase compiling speed by 10-50% depends by project size/quality (personaly i can't install PIL on pypy, so render_template not works :/)
